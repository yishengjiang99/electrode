# Building large scale universal React Web Applications

Electrode Web is a full stack, end-to-end, rapid application development platform for Node.js and React.js based applications.

Originally designed for Walmart-specific use cases, we decided to open-source electrode with the hope that it will be useful to developers in the JavaScript community.
This is the same version that is used to power the Walmart.com eCommerce website.

- NOTE: We maintain additional code for internal Walmart systems. If you are a Walmart developer, please check internal docs to get started.

**Do you have 5 minutes?** That is how long it takes to scaffold your first app. Try it now!

## electrode quick start

1. Run the following command in your console/terminal:

```bash
npm init @xarc/app my-app

2. Wait a moment for the installer to complete the build.
3. When complete, the console will display `Created react/node webapp in directory 'my-app'`
4. Follow the instructions in the console.
5. When complete, open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
6. To stop the DEV server, press `Q`
